Preprocessing_Scripts – Joint Horizon Task Project
==================================================

This folder contains MATLAB scripts used to preprocess and analyze behavioral data from the Horizon Task in the Joint Horizon (JH) study.

These scripts compute key behavioral metrics and generate variables used in statistical analyses reported in the project’s associated preprint.

Contents:
---------

- `acc.m`  
  → Computes **accuracy** across different conditions.

- `directedexploration.m`  
  → Calculates **directed exploration**, defined by whether participants choose options with higher uncertainty.

- `randomexploration.m`  
  → Calculates **random exploration**, typically inferred from deviation from value-maximizing choices.

- `Impulsivity_and_Random_Exploration.m`  
  → Analyzes the relationship between **impulsivity (short horizon)** and **random exploration** tendencies.

- `indivdual_psychcurve_analysis_equal.m`  
  → Fits and visualizes **psychometric functions** (for equal information trials) in the **individual condition**.

- `psy_curves_equal.m`  
  → Group-level psychometric curve analysis (equal information trials), used to assess choice probabilities.

- `time_order_2way_anova_LONG.m`  
  → 2-way ANOVA for **time-order effects** (first vs. second agent) in **long-horizon trials**.

- `time_order_2way_anova_SHORT.m`  
  → Same as above, but for **short-horizon trials**.

How to Use:
-----------

These scripts assume that preprocessed `.mat` files from the `Preprocessed_Data` folder are already loaded. Most scripts can be executed as standalone files to generate summary figures or statistics. Ensure you are using MATLAB R2019b or later.
