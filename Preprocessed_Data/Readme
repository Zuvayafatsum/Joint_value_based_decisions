Preprocessed_Data – Joint Horizon Task Project
==============================================

This folder contains MATLAB `.mat` files with cleaned and condition-specific behavioral data from the Joint Horizon Task. These datasets are the result of aggregating raw session files into structured formats suitable for further statistical and modeling analyses.

Contents:
---------

1. `indivdata_equal.mat`  
   → Contains behavioral data from participants in the **individual condition**, restricted to trials with **equal information**.

2. `indivdata_unequal.mat`  
   → Contains behavioral data from the **individual condition**, but only for **unequal information** trials.

3. `jointdata_equal.mat`  
   → Contains behavioral data from **collective sessions**, for **equal information** trials.

4. `jointdata_unequal.mat`  
   → Behavioral data from **collective sessions**, for **unequal information** trials.

Structure:
----------

Each `.mat` file contains a MATLAB table where rows represent individual trials. Common variables include:
- `subID`: Subject identifier
- `horizon`: Horizon condition (1 or 6)
- `choice`: Chosen option
- `reward`: Received reward
- `infoType`: Information condition (equal/unequal)
- `exploration_class`: Classification of whether the choice was exploratory
- `condition`: Individual or collective session

These files are designed to be directly usable in statistical scripts for computing choice behavior metrics (e.g., accuracy, directed/random exploration, time-order effects).

Refer to the preprocessing scripts for how these files were generated.
